<!--what is the diffrence and versions of HTML and XHTML-->

<!--HTML vs XHTML
XHTML is, basically, an extension to HTML. You can think of it as an updated, stricter version of HTML4. Therefore, there aren’t too many differences between the two. Below we have listed some of the most notable ones:

HTML accepts that some elements may not contain the closing tag. XHTML expects that all elements with no exception include a closing tag. (Note: A closing tag is added at the end of an element, such as a paragraph. They usually consist of the name of the element preceded by a backslash. Thus, an opening tag for a paragraph is <p>, and the closing tag is </p>)
XHTML, unlike HTML, does not allow elements to overlap.
XHTML requires that all attribute values (e.g., font size) are quoted – even the numeric ones. There is no such requirement in HTML.
For a document to be valid XHTML, attributes cannot be minimized.
There are also some minor differences in the way both languages handle empty elements.
The differences mentioned above are some of the most obvious ones. The full list is substantially longer, however, it, by a large margin, consists of features too subtle to encounter on a daily basis. These can be further explored by referring to XHTML documentation. The key thing to remember is that XHTML was developed to fix some shortcomings of HTML by introducing certain features of XML.-->
<!--
   "versions of XHTML"
   December 1998 saw the publication of a W3C Working Draft entitled Reformulating HTML in XML. This introduced Voyager, the codename for a new markup language based on HTML 4, but adhering to the stricter syntax rules of XML. By February 1999 the name of the specification had changed to XHTML 1.0: The Extensible HyperText Markup Language, and in January 2000 it was officially adopted as a W3C Recommendation.[46] There are three formal DTDs for XHTML 1.0, corresponding to the three different versions of HTML 4.01:

XHTML 1.0 Strict is the XML equivalent to strict HTML 4.01, and includes elements and attributes that have not been marked deprecated in the HTML 4.01 specification. As of November 2015, XHTML 1.0 Strict is the document type used for the homepage of the website of the World Wide Web Consortium.
XHTML 1.0 Transitional is the XML equivalent of HTML 4.01 Transitional, and includes the presentational elements (such as center, font and strike) excluded from the strict version.
XHTML 1.0 Frameset is the XML equivalent of HTML 4.01 Frameset, and allows for the definition of frameset documents—a common Web feature in the late 1990s.
The second edition of XHTML 1.0 became a W3C Recommendation in August 2002

   HTML5 is the latest version of HTML. HTML has evolved with the passage of time. Other versions of HTML include HTML 1.0, HTML 2.0, HTML 3.2, HTML 4.01 and XHTML.

"Versions of HTML"
HTML has never been like this, what it is right now. HTML, like many other languages has evolved with the passage of time and today it's much better and versatile than it was a long time ago.

Different Version of HTML has different properties. But today we use HTML5, HTML5 is the latest version of HTML.

1)HTML Versions List
2)HTML 1.0: released in 1991
3)HTML 2.0: released in 1995
4)HTML 3.2: released in 1997
5)HTML 4.01: released in 1999
6)XHTML: released in 2000
7)HTML5: released in 2014
